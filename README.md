# Periodic Table Study Game

This is a website for studying the periodic table through memory games. Written in ReactJS to easily manipulate the markup, the purpose of this site is to make learning a subject of science that often feels dull to the average high school student more interesting through interactive games. We live in a world where the way we learn has changed, but the availability of tools that match the way we learn has failed to. My aim is to bridge that gap with creative code and collaboration.
